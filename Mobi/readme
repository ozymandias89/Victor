Mobi software allows to load pdb file. Pdb file must be created with NMR technology. Mobi can calculate
amino acid's residue mobility inside protein.
The software can load the pdb file entirely (all models of protein), or just partly (only selected models).
The user can choose the chain to load, the default is first chain of pdb file.
Different metrics evaluate mobility part of the protein for example the everage scale distance,
standard deviation, scale distance, the evaluation of angle phi, psi, and various logic mask.

Mobi is a Victor folder, inside are located subfolder APP which includes mobi.cc file that 
includes main.
After compiling project the executable files are located in /Victor/bin/ with mobi's name.
For execute Mobi launch with no option or with option -h. 
A help menu will appear showing how to use the program. 
The output file will locate in directory /Victor/Mobi/data. 
Remind that the output file must be deleted if you want rerun the program, 
if this were not the case, the output file could be added in append to the file.

==Usage==
Requirement: 
Input: NMR pdb file.

Execution: ./mobi pathpdbfile (options in addition)

Option:		
		-o	namefile for output to personalize the name of the output file, default is “stdout”
		-v	set verbosity of all object
		-c 	set chain of protein to read (default is first chain)
		-m	to load a restricted numbers of models and not all present models in the file
		-s	modify value of mobility of average scaled distance
		-d	modify value of mobility of standard deviation of scaled distance
		-y	modify value of mobility of angle PHI
		-x	modify value of mobility of angle PSI
		-h	help

Output: Output is two files, the first will be a fasta file with different mobility metrics, the second will be 
	a pdb file with save models and the last column changed with standard deviation and average scaled 
		distance * 100.
